One for my Courier

September 20th, 2020 - Full Install: ~33GB.

OVERVIEW
========

This ReadMe is designed to help you with acquiring a fully-functional installation for One for my Courier, a modlist built around Tale of Two Wastelands, combining the worlds of Fallout 3 and New Vegas, with a few supporting mods added in. 

GOALS
=====

1.  Set up a successful installation of TTW

2.  Successfully download, ensure proper load order of, and begin playing this modlist

SPECIFICATIONS
==============

Due to the way TTW works, I will NOT be including an installation of it in my modlist. Instead, you will be responsible for downloading it yourself. Don't worry, however, as I'm here to help.

First off, you will need:

-   A clean, fresh, and LEGAL installation of Fallout New Vegas

-   A clean, fresh, and LEGAL installation of Fallout 3

-   A little bit of patience for the Tale of Two Wastelands installation

MILESTONES
==========

Install Fallout 3 and New Vegas on the same drive
-------------------------------------------------

This part is self-explanatory. You'll want to go to the installations of each game, and remove all files present in the install folder (For example, steamapps/common/Fallout 3). Once done, go ahead and re-install it. This ensures that any installs you have will be totally clean, which is important for the next steps. While you're here, run each game once, and exit the launchers once your graphics settings are determined.

Install One For My Courier via Wabbajack
-----------------------------------------

I know this seems odd to do now, based on my earlier statements, but I promise it's important. 

1.  Simply open the Wabbajack UI, which can be acquired from here if you don't already have it: <https://www.wabbajack.org/#/>. 

2.  Once you've installed Wabbajack, or if you already have it, open it up and choose "Browse Modists". 

3.  From there, you will download "One for my Courier" by clicking the little down arrow. 

4.  After that, you will choose an installation folder (I recommend something like "D:/One for my Courier", substituting D: for any drive available.) This CANNOT be where Wabbajack.exe is located, nor your Fallout 3 or New Vegas folders.

5.  Downloads will auto-populate for you, but you can change that location if you so choose. 

6.  From there, just click the "play" button and let it do the rest.

Install Tale of Two Wastelands

Now comes the big one. I will be writing instructions for this in a way that results in TTW being installed to a separate folder. Believe me, this is far, FAR easier than just using the Data folder. I will also be bullet pointing these steps, to make them more digestible:

1.  Download the TTW 3.2 installer from here: <https://taleoftwowastelands.com/dl>

2.  Extract this zip folder to a new, empty folder, preferably on your desktop for easy access. 

3.  Download the 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 updates, extracting those contents into the same folder

4.  Run the TTW Install.exe present in this folder and choose the base 3.2 for now. Install it. 

5.  Make sure your NV and FO3 installation locations are correct.

6.  For the Tale of Two Wastelands location, set it to an empty folder on your desktop.

7.  Repeat step 4, choosing 3.2.1 then  3.2.2, installing to the same folder from step 6. REMEMBER: The big, green "INSTALL" button is your friend.

8.  Cut + Paste this folder into your "One for my Courier" mods folder.

9.  Once installed, open Mod organizer 2 which Wabbajack provided for you. This will be in your "One for my Courier" folder that we created earlier. 

10. Press F5 to refresh MO2. then enable your TTW mod install in the lefthand panel.

11. After this, download the "loadorder.txt" file, linked below, and place it in the "profiles -> One for my Courier" folder. 

12. Link to load order: <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AZ_Or_X9IccYmYCWhJIt8eh8zNpnDK6k/view?usp=sharing>

13. Return to MO2, and hit F5. This should refresh the load order on the right panel. 

Copy Game Folder Files

Copy the files present in the "Game Folder Files" folder, which you should have in your "One for my Courier" install folder, to your Fallout: New Vegas install folder. This will give you an up-to-date copy of NVSE, which we will need to run the list successfully. REMEMBER: Only copy the files WITHIN the Game Folder Files folder, NOT the entire folder itself. After that, simply choose NVSE from the dropdown in the top right corner of MO2, and click Run.

BEFORE YOU BEGIN - IMPORTANT

-   You might notice that only parts 1 and 2 of New Vegas Bounties is included. The reason part 3 isn't is because, while I initially planned to include it, it proved to be far too...inconsistent to warrant remaining in the list. 

-   Ensure that the TTW mod that you installed earlier is higher in the left pane than the standalone JIP Plugin. The installation includes this plugin, but it is not updated, and so you must let JIP overwrite it. I'll include an image of what I mean at the end of this section.

-   Be careful with autosaves. I have been informed that they have some brief freezes, but they can be annoying. 

-   You will see some flickering in the world from the LodGen. New Vegas is not as prepared for this as Skyrim is, so these are, sadly, inevitable. 

-   In the left pane, you will see a mod named "IStewieAI's Tweaks Custom INI (TTW)". This is an INI file with many, many options that you may use to change how the game works. For example, I have the experience rate set to 60% of base values due to the massive amount of added content amongst two games. Feel free to experiment if you feel so inclined.

Starting the game

Once loaded into the game, you will start in the ending tunnel for Fallout 3's Vault 101 tutorial section. If you wish to play through it, you can disable the "TTW Quick Start" mod. This should not cause any issues. Either way, turn around and, next to the vault door in this tunnel is a computer. This is provided by AWOP, which increases spawns all over the wasteland, and is meant to give you a bonus starting loadout to be better prepared. Choose wisely.  After that, set up your appearance, stats, and skills at the door prior to leaving the tunnel. IMPORTANT: Regardless of whether you use the quickstart or not, the TTW HIGHLY RECOMMENDS that you start in Fallout 3, and so do I.

MCM settings

The only MCM settings I can think of that you NEED to set are:

In Just Mods, disable the Loot Menu and Hold Breath options.
In Enhanced Item Info, disable Value/Weight, or V/W
